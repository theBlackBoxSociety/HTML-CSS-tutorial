# HTML, CSS & JS
In web development, there are several different tools working in tandem to make things run. The pieces can seem overwhelming at first, but let's take it step by step.

## These are the requirements
- a browser
- a text editor
- an FTP client 
- webspace / webhosting

## Browsers

- There are standards for HTML, CSS and JS, but each browser implements these in their own way. You can never be completely sure that a page will look exactly the same in all browsers.
- Chrome for desktop is not the same as Chrome for mobile. Same with Safari.
- You should test your work in different browsers, and on different devices.

- On desktop, a page should at least work in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- On mobile, you should test in Chrome and Safari.
- Testing is especially important with CSS and JavaScript.

### Most popular browsers (Oct 2020)

On desktop:    
- Chrome (Windows + Mac): 70%
- Firefox (Windows + Mac): 8%
- Safari (Mac only): 8%
- rest: Edge (Windows only), Internet Explorer (Windows only), Opera (Windows + Mac), ...

On mobile:    
- Chrome (iOS + Android): 61% + 7% (Samsung Internet) = 68% 
- Safari (iOS): 20%

## Text / Code editor
You are free to choose. 

Recommendations:
 
- https://atom.io
- http://brackets.io
- https://www.sublimetext.com

Pick one editor and learn it well, especially the shortcuts. I'll be using Atom in class.


## FTP Client
Again free to choose. 

Recommendations:
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (windows & OSX)
- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

## Webhosting
It's common that your workflow will consist of testing and running locally (on your computer), and then uploading and deploying remotely.

Often in web development, you'll build something and test it by running it on your computer without putting it out on the internet at all. In this case, your computer is acting as a small-scale server. That's referred to as running something **locally**. Because a server is essentially just a program, they can live any number of places, including on your laptop where you're the only one who can access it. Of course, we're going to pretty quickly want to start putting things out to the outside world, aka TEH INTERNETZ, more formally known as **a remote server**.
