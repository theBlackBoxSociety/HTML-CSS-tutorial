*---[ A crashcourse in Code]---*

In web development, there are several different tools working in tandem to make things run. The pieces can seem overwhelming at first, but let's take it step by step.

## Our requirements
- [a browser](#browsers)
- [a text editor](#text--code-editor)
- [an FTP client](#ftp-client)
- [webspace / webhosting](#webhosting)

## Browsers

- There are standards for HTML, CSS and JS, but each browser implements these in their own way. You can never be completely sure that a page will look exactly the same in all browsers.
- Chrome for desktop is not the same as Chrome for mobile. Same with Safari.
- You should test your work in different browsers, and on different devices.

- On desktop, a page should at least work in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
- On mobile, you should test in Chrome and Safari.
- Testing is especially important with CSS and JavaScript.

### Most popular browsers (Oct 2020)

On desktop:    
- Chrome (Windows + Mac): 70%
- Firefox (Windows + Mac): 8%
- Safari (Mac only): 8%
- rest: Edge (Windows only), Internet Explorer (Windows only), Opera (Windows + Mac), ...

On mobile:    
- Chrome (iOS + Android): 61% + 7% (Samsung Internet) = 68% 
- Safari (iOS): 20%

## Text / Code editor
You are free to choose. 

Recommendations:
 
- https://atom.io
- http://brackets.io
- https://www.sublimetext.com

Pick one editor and learn it well, especially the shortcuts. I'll be using Atom in class.


## FTP Client
Again free to choose. 

Recommendations:
- [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (windows & OSX)
- [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)

## Webhosting
It's common that your workflow will consist of testing and running locally (on your computer), and then uploading and deploying remotely.
