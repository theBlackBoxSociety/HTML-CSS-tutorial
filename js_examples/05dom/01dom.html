	<h1 id="intro">Introduction</h1>
	<p id="message">Hello.</p>
	<p>This is Ground Control 
	to Major Tom
	You've really made the grade
	And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear
	Now it's time to leave the capsule 
	if you dare</p>

	<p>This is <strong>Major Tom</strong> to Ground Control
	I'm stepping through the door
	And I'm floating 
	in a most peculiar way
	And the stars look very different today</p>

	<p>For here
	Am I sitting in a tin can
	Far above the world
	Planet Earth is blue
	And there's nothing I can do</p>
